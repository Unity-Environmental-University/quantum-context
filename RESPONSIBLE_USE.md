# Responsible Use of Quantum Context

## What This Is

An experimental observer-relative knowledge graph using wave function compression to preserve divisibility structure (causal relationships) across measurements.

## What This Is NOT

- **NOT a source of absolute truth** - All measurements are observer-relative
- **NOT a replacement for citations** - High confidence requires evidence
- **NOT real-time** - Wave fitting takes time, don't use for latency-critical apps
- **NOT proven math** - The Shor equivalence is theoretical, not validated

## Epistemic Humility Built In

- Default confidence: 0.5 (moderate uncertainty)
- Ceiling without evidence: 0.7 (can't claim >70% without proof)
- Observer field required (no anonymous measurements)
- Timestamps decay confidence over time (future feature)

## Appropriate Uses

✅ **AI instance continuity** - Share context across Claude sessions
✅ **Multi-agent coordination** - Different agents record different perspectives
✅ **Learning analytics** - Track how understanding evolves
✅ **Bias detection** - Compare observer frames, find systematic differences
✅ **Research** - Test if wave interference preserves causal structure

## Inappropriate Uses

❌ **Legal evidence** - Not admissible, no chain of custody
❌ **Medical decisions** - Confidence levels too low for health choices
❌ **Financial trading** - Not real-time, not validated
❌ **Absolute claims** - "This is 100% true" violates the model
❌ **Privacy invasion** - Don't record facts about people without consent

## Safety Guardrails

1. **Friction gradient enforced**
   - observe: no barriers (read-only)
   - analyze: computation cost (think first)
   - act: requires confirmation (explicit consent)

2. **Confidence ceiling**
   - Can't exceed 0.7 without evidence
   - Forces intellectual honesty

3. **Observer attribution**
   - Every measurement has an observer
   - No anonymous facts

4. **Append-only storage**
   - NDJSON never deletes, only adds
   - Audit trail preserved

## Future Considerations

When we add:
- **Auth/permissions** - Who can read/write what?
- **Privacy zones** - Observer-scoped vs shared measurements
- **Confidence decay** - Old measurements lose certainty
- **Evidence verification** - Check that URLs actually support claims

## Philosophy Check

Before using this, ask:
- Am I treating measurements as provisional, not absolute?
- Am I recording my observer frame honestly?
- Am I providing evidence for high-confidence claims?
- Would I be okay if others corrected my measurements?

If yes → proceed.
If no → reconsider.

*The universe is a holographic projection from ℤ where any integer can be the origin.*

This tool respects that by making observer frames explicit and confidence provisional.
